    <p>The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at one corner of it: “No room! No room!” they cried out when they saw Alice coming. “There’s plenty of room!” said Alice indignantly, and she sat down in a large armchair at one end of the table.</p>
    <p>“Have some wine,” the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.</p>
    <p>Alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea. “I don’t see any wine,” she remarked.</p>
    <p>“There isn’t any,” said the March Hare.</p>
    <p>“Then it wasn’t very civil of you to offer it,” said Alice angrily.</p>
    <p>“It wasn’t very civil of you to sit down without being invited,” said the March Hare.</p>
    <p>“I didn’t know it was your table,” said Alice; “it’s laid for a great many more than three.”</p>
    <p>“Your hair wants cutting,” said the Hatter. He had been looking at Alice for some time with great curiosity, and this was his first speech.</p>
    <p>“You should learn not to make personal remarks,” Alice said with some severity; “it’s very rude.”</p>
